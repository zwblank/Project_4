# Project_4

## Project Overview:
The aim of our project is to explore real estate data to predict home prices. In this project, we examine aspects of homes, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. to predict the value of other homes.

The main question we ask of the data is what a home is worth based on its features. We also analyzed the data to determine which features are most important in determining home price.

The main machine learning model we used was a random forest regressor. We also compared it to multivariate linear regression, and support vector regression. We also used techniques, such as a correlation matrix to pick out the most important features to use for the model.
